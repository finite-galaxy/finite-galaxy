 1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
 licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
 privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
 the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
 assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
 extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
 Rights, but not otherwise.

 licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
 reserves any right to collect such royalties.

 information.
 .
 3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
 information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
 reasonably practicable.
 .
 b. ShareAlike.

 c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
 all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
 replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
 Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
 Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
 a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
 EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS

 IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
 WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
 ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
 KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT

 INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
 COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
 USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
 ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
 DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
 IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

 Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
 distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so

 cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be

 which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along

 independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
 collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
 considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of this

 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
 a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
 Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
 Collections;
 .
 b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
 including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to
 clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made
 to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
 original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a
 modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
 .
 c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated
 in Collections; and,
 .
 d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 .
 e. For the avoidance of doubt:
 .
 i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in

 compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
 reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
 exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
 .
 ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
 which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
 compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the
 exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
 of the rights granted under this License; and,
 .
 iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
 collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the
 Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
 voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise
 by You of the rights granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in
 other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly
 granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
 subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
 a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
 of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
 Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
 Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
 on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of
 the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
 recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
 Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
 to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
 Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
 Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
 measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
 Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
 the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
 incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
 apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
 License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
 must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit
 as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an
 Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
 practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
 Section 4(c), as requested.
 .
 b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the
 terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with
 the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons
 jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that
 contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,
 Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible
 License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses
 mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If
 you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses
 mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must
 comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the
 following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for,
 the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You
 Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any
 terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable
 License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise
 the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable
 License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the
 Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy
 of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly
 Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation,
 You may not impose any effective technological measures on the
 Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation
 from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
 terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the
 Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require
 the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to
 the terms of the Applicable License.
 .
 c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
 Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
 Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
 provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
 name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
 and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party
 or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
 attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
 terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party
 or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
 extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
 specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
 refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
 and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an
 Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation
 (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or
 "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit
 required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable
 manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or
 Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all
 contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as
 part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
 credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of
 doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the
 purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising
 Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly
 assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the
 Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate,
 of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior
 written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
 Parties.
 .
 d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
 otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
 Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
 Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
 take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
 prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor
 agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
 of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
 make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
 modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
 Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,
 as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
 applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your
 right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
 but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
 WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
 OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
 BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
 a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
 automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
 Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
 from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
 terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
 compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
 survive any termination of this License.
 .
 b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
 Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
 any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
 withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
 required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
 License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
 stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
 a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
 the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
 terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 .
 b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
 offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
 terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 .
 c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
 applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
 the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
 by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
 the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
 enforceable.
 .
 d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
 breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
 and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
 .
 e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
 respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
 agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
 here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
 may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
 modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
 .
 f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
 License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
 for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
 September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
 Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996
 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).
 These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
 jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced
 according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
 those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the
 standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
 includes additional rights not granted under this License, such
 additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this
 License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under
 applicable law.

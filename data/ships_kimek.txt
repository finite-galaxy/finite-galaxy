  description `The Spire is the largest passenger transport in Coalition space, able to carry nearly two hundred individuals… as long as they're comfortable staying in the tiny bunk rooms that are primarily designed to meet the needs of a Kimek. Most of the connecting spaces are too narrow for an Arachi to walk comfortably, the beds are too short for a Saryd to stretch out, … and the ceilings too low for a human to stand up straight.`

  description "The Sisensis Bastion is designed as a heavy defence platform to accompany freighter convoys, in addition to having enough cargo capacity to serve as a freighter in its own right. Because of its heavy armament, it is classified as a warship rather than a freighter."

  description "The Clipper is the smaller sister ship to the venerable Sisensis Bastion. Although not able to carry as much cargo, Clippers are versatile ships that can be used as passenger transports, couriers, or even warships in a pinch, and they come with enough free space to be customized based on an individual captain's needs."

  description "The Mark II Drone is used exclusively by the Republic Navy. Although very weak and easy to destroy, they can be quite effective in large numbers. Because drones do not need to accomodate life support systems, a cockpit, bunks, cargo space, or shield emitters, they can have similar firepower and a stronger hull than larger fighters or interceptors."

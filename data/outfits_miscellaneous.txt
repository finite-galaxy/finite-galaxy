  description "If you're in the habit of carrying illegal cargo or outfits, this plating increases the odds that a scan of your ship will fail to detect it. The more of these you install, the better your chances of evading detection. They won't keep anyone from noticing if you're flying an unlicensed ship, however. Furthermore, it reduces your ability to vent heat."

  description "Ramscoop technology has been almost unchanged for centuries, because with nearly every system in human space settled there has not been a pressing need for ships to harvest their own fuel. But with the Free Worlds war making travel once again more difficult, some engineers in the Tarazed recently invented a much-improved ramscoop for use in their merchant fleets."

  description "In the early days of space exploration, when ships could travel through half a dozen systems before encountering an established colony where they could refuel, ramscoops were an essential piece of equipment, harvesting plasma from the solar wind to refill your hyperspace fuel tanks. Although you can install more than one ramscoop, additional ramscoops on a single ship are not as effective as the first."
  description "  (As a safety measure, all ships are able to harvest tiny amounts of fuel by flying close to a star, but this outfit allows you to accumulate fuel much more quickly. The closer you are to the star, the faster fuel will accumulate.)"

  description "The Centaur Bactrian is the last of the great city-ships, a design hearkening back to the early days of space colonization when a long-distance vessel needed to be a self-contained world, able to survive for weeks at a time without encountering an inhabited planet. It is not only a freighter, but a carrier, and a capable warship either at short range or at a distance. Naturally, this versatility also makes it extremely expensive, and the Bactrian is not normally for sale to ordinary citizens."

  description "The design of the Mongrel seems to be a Mule condensed to the level of a Dagger, and as you look at the cockpit nestled between the massive gun port and turret mount, you wonder where the power systems are supposed to go. Needless to say, there is no room for a hyperdrive, fuel barrels, or cargo. The Mongrel is categorized as a bomber rather than a fighter, because of its relatively high weapon space, and because its awkward shape makes it unable to fit into ordinary fighter bays. Though its operation range is currently rather limited, it seems flexible enough to become a dangerous addition to warfleets, if ever any bomber carriers will be designed."

  description "The Mule is as much of a hodgepodge as its looks suggest. The Centaur ship designers combined a good deal of cargo space with a decent amount of weaponry and even a fighter bay, and ended up with a ship that is mostly used as a freighter but must be classified as a warship because of its heavy armament and shields."

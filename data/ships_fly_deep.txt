  description "Fly Deep's Flivver is the fastest ship for sale, able to outspeed even Lionheart's Arrow or Scout. As a consequence, it has space for neither cargo nor passengers nor heavy weaponry. Flivvers are sold mostly to wealthy individuals who want to be able to travel the stars without needing to share a bunk room on a merchant transport with common people, and to rich kids obsessed with racing."

  description "The Headhunter is one of the newest ships designed by Fly Deep: a versatile ship that can serve equally well for carrying valuable cargo, escorting freighters, or bounty hunting. It is capable of overtaking and defeating most other interceptors, such as Betelgeuse's Berserker, hence its name. As with all of Fly Deep's designs, the Headhunter's hull is mostly composite fiber rather than metal, sacrificing armour strength for the sake of lighter weight and faster movement. "

  description "This Arrow has had numerous modifications to its hull and internal systems to make more room for outfits – mostly with combat in mind. More shields, weapons, engines, outfit space, and a turret mount nearly push this ship into the Corvette category, and definitely make it one of the heaviest Interceptors you're likely to find."

  description "The Yggdrasill Bounder was designed back in the days when the galaxy was more sparsely populated, and ships prospecting for habitable worlds or worlds rich in resources would often travel far away from any habitable ports where they would be able to refuel. Although the galaxy has now been much more thoroughly explored, the Bounder remains a popular ship for long-distance travel."

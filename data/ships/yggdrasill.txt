  description "The Centipede is the ultimate freighter, able to carry more cargo than any other human ship. It is also, however, an incredibly slow ship and difficult to manoeuvre, especially when fully loaded. Some freight caravans use multiple smaller freighters instead of Centipedes just to avoid the hassle of constantly having to wait for the Centipede to properly align itself for hyperspace travel."

  description "The Jupiter is by far the largest, most powerful, and most expensive human starship, dwarfing everything else. It is practically a moving battle station, equipped with powerful cannons and capable of carrying a dozen fighters. Only a small number of Jupiters has been produced and those are mostly kept in reserve, due to their very high running costs and replacement price: they are simply too valuable to risk losing."

  description "For centuries, the Mars was the largest warship produced by the Republic Navy Yard, but now they seem quite small compared to a Venus or a Saturn. Armed with a variety of weapons, and with relatively good manoeuvrability for a ship its size, the Mars is equally capable at fending off small fighters or bombarding larger ships."

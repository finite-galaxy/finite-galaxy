  description `Saryd place high value both on solitude, but also on community and collaboration. So, it is not surprising that their smallest spacefaring vessel requires a team of at least two individuals to operate it. It is quite common for a lone Saryd to take on a Kimek or Arachi copilot as a way of building cross-species friendships.`

  description `When the first wars were fought against the Quarg, the Saryd had been spacefaring for more than ten thousand Earth years, and their starship technology was considerably more advanced than the Kimek or the Arachi. At that time, ships similar to the modern Sojourner were the most powerful capital ships in the Coalition fleet.`

  description `Travellers were originally designed as science vessels, thousands of years ago before the Saryd had catalogued all the life forms and physical phenomena of every world in Coalition space. Today, many Saryd communities still choose to live in a Traveller and journey together from system to system rather than putting down roots on a planet.`

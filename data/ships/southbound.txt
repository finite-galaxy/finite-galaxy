  description `After introducing the "Type F" cargo pod for the Hauler, it became apparent to merchant captains that the new carriers could offer more flexibility within their fleet, if there were a cargo box they could attach to the fighter arms. Enter the "F6-C: Boxwing", the fighter that doesn't fight, but carries cargo instead. Cargo preservation equipment gives the Boxwing much more mass and very poor heat dissipation characteristics compared to other fighters. That it cannot carry any weapons is only part of the reason jocks call it "Flying Coffin" amongst themselves; besides the ship resembling one and being very sluggish, the pilot "seat" doubles as a bunk, and is cramped beyond the comfort level of most. The interactive panoramic window H.U.D. is the only thing that keeps claustrophobic episodes from becoming a major problem.`

The Firebird is also a very rugged ship and easy to repair; supposedly a few of the Firebirds that fought in those wars are still in service today."

Because of its limited cargo and passenger space, the primary way for a Harpy pilot to pay the bills is by hunting pirates… or by becoming one. In either case, it is a perilous way to earn a living."

  description `Southbound Shipyards quickly answered the Free Worlds' call for a carrier by building modified cargo containers for Haulers – adding a pair of Fighter docking arms, some additional outfit space, and even a couple of bunks. Access to the fighters from within the ship is so inconvenient that most pilots opt to just stay aboard their fighters when in flight. While the technical name for this ship is "Hauler I: Type F", Southbound assembly workers started calling the single container variant the "Nest" due to its complement of Hag Fighters, and the name stuck.`

Given this fact, the Free Worlds have asked Southbound to restrict sale of the "Hauler III: Type F", "Skein" to its military only.`

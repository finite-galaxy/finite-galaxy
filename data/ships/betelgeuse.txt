  description "The Argosy from Vortex Shipyards is very popular with merchants not because of its capacity, which is actually smaller than the Star Freighter, but because it can hold its own in combat against pirate interceptors."
  description "  The Argosy is also a very easy ship to upgrade with faster engines or more powerful weapons as needed, so many privately owned Argosies have very different capabilities than the stock model."

  description "Once one of the most popular interceptor-class ships, the Berserker's popularity is now waning in favour of more modern and versatile ships like the Falcon. Although large numbers are still produced by Betelgeuse Shipyards, many other Furies that are in service today are more than half a century old."

  description "The Fury is Betelgeuse Shipyard's popular design of escort ship. They have greater firepower than most other interceptor-class vessels, meaning that any pirate flying solo will think twice before attacking a convoy that is accompanied by a Fury. However, Berserkers are also less manoeuvrable than other small ships."

  description `Voted the "ugliest ship in the sky" by Stars and Starships Magazine, the Protector is a typical example of brutally efficient Corporation engineering. It is basically nothing more than seven turrets attached to a set of engines and crew's quarters, designed as a defence platform that can accompany merchant convoys.`

  description "The Vanguard is Betelgeuse's newest warship intended for the heavy anti-pirate defence market. Vanguards offer an unusual feature set, focusing on powerful fixed guns and featuring Corporation Systems' latest automation technologies, resulting in an atypically low crew complement for a ship its size. Few capital ships will endure for long under the withering fusillade of gunfire that it can unleash against those in front of it."

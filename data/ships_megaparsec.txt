  description "The Megaparsec Quicksilver is a warship built around a single concept: to design the smallest and fastest ship capable of carrying two particle cannons. Because of its speed and long weapons range, the Quicksilver can keep a safe distance from most targets and bombard them with particle bursts until they are destroyed."

  description "After their Quicksilver light warship with its armament of particle cannons became a large success with convoy escorts and planetary defence forces, Megaparsec decided to develop a larger ship with similar manoeuvrability but heavier firepower. The Manta is the result: a ship with enough long-range firepower that fleeing from a battle with it is almost impossible."

  description "The Megaparsec Quicksilver is a warship built around a single concept: to design the smallest and fastest ship capable of carrying two particle cannons. Because of its speed and long weapons range, the Quicksilver can keep a safe distance from most targets and bombard them with particle bursts until they are destroyed."

  description "The Splinter is the largest warship produced by the Megaparsec shipyard. It is designed to be faster and more manoeuvrable than other ships of a similar size, in order to serve as a heavy escort ship or as part of a planetary defence and patrol fleet. Because of its intended use in merchant convoys, it also has a fair amount of cargo space."

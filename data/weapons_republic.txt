  description "This simple cartridge is the ammunition for the Gatling Gun, with a projectile of depleted nuclear fuel or an illuminated tracer round. Since this ammunition is primarily manufactured on pirate worlds by slave children in poor working conditions, muzzle velocity can vary by up to 30%, and tracer distribution is seldom uniform."

  description `When Dr. Richard J. Gatling invented the rapid-fire gun bearing his name in the 19th Century A.D., he hoped that its destructiveness would lead to the end of war itself. Over a millennium later, this modern incarnation of the gatling gun sees action in the stars, a testament to its fundamentally robust design - and Dr. Gatling's naivete. While capable of a high fire rate, this gun needs to cool down for twice as long as it fires, and can only sustain a maximum of three seconds of continuous fire.`

  description "The Javelin Pod fires a rapid stream of unguided missiles. A Javelin Pod does far more damage than any gun of a comparable size, and has a longer range as well, but once a ship has fired off all its ammunition it must leave combat and find a planet where it can buy more, which makes Javelins less useful in protracted battles. As a result, they are very popular with pirates as a way to quickly disable a small target."

  description "The Sidewinder Missile is designed by Lovelace Labs, which is ironically also the designer of the Anti-Missile Turret.

  description "  Although not as powerful or cheap as the popular Meteor missiles, Sidewinders have several advantages, including their superior maneuverability, better tracking systems, and protective casings that make them much harder for anti-missile systems to destroy."

The only way to overcome it is by firing missiles in a cluster so that while one is being targeted, the others can get through, and as a result all missile systems on the market now default to firing in clusters if multiple copies of the same launcher are installed, rather than staggering their fire as ordinary guns do."

  description "The Flivver is the fastest ship for sale, designed to outspeed anything else. As a consequence, it has space for neither cargo nor passengers nor heavy weaponry. Flivvers are sold mostly to wealthy individuals who want to be able to travel the stars without needing to share a bunk room on a merchant transport with common people, and to rich youths obsessed with racing."

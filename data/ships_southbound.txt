  description `After introducing the "Type F" cargo pod for the Hauler, it became apparent to merchant captains that the new carriers could offer more flexibility within their fleet, if there were a cargo box they could attach to the fighter arms. Enter the "F6-C: Boxwing", the fighter that doesn't fight, but carries cargo instead. Cargo preservation equipment gives the Boxwing much more mass and very poor heat dissipation characteristics compared to other fighters. That it cannot carry any weapons is only part of the reason jocks call it "Flying Coffin" amongst themselves; besides the ship resembling one and being very sluggish, the pilot "seat" doubles as a bunk, and is cramped beyond the comfort level of most. The interactive panoramic window H.U.D. is the only thing that keeps claustrophobic episodes from becoming a major problem.`

  description "When the Free Worlds started requesting a carrier solution from its local shipyards, Southbound Shipyards quickly saw that a few modifications could make their entry level interceptor into a top tier fighter. Numerous parts that make up the Hag are shared with the Harpy assembly line, so it's no surprise that even trimmed down to fit into a fighter bay, the Hag bears strong resemblance to its hyperspace-faring cousin."

  description "Classified as an interceptor rather than a fighter because it has its own "Hyperdrive" instead of needing to be carried inside a larger ship, the Southbound Harpy is the smallest and cheapest combat ship available. Because of its limited cargo and passenger space, the primary way for a Harpy pilot to pay the bills is by hunting pirates… or by becoming one. In either case, it is a perilous way to earn a living."
  description "  Insurance reports indicate that as many as two out of every three first-time ship buyers who choose to pilot a Harpy lose their ship (and often, their life as well) within the first month of owning it."

  description `Southbound Shipyards quickly answered the Free Worlds' call for a carrier by building modified cargo containers for Haulers – adding a pair of Fighter docking arms, some additional outfit space, and even a couple of bunks. Access to the fighters from within the ship is so inconvenient that most pilots opt to just stay aboard their fighters when in flight. While the technical name for this ship is "Hauler I: Type F", Southbound assembly workers started calling the single container variant the "Nest" due to its complement of Hag Fighters, and the name stuck.`

  description `Southbound Shipyards' new fighter-carrying containers have created a new use for what many considered an outdated design. Four external fighter bays make this the biggest civilian carrier on the market, if a little awkward as a warship. After Southbound assembly workers successfully named the "Nest", "Hauler II: Type F" was quickly dubbed the "Roost" to continue the theme.`

  description `This particular cockpit and engine set has found itself attached to three of Southbound Shipyards' new "Type F" Fighter-carrier pods. When the Free Worlds asked for a carrier, they did not expect one that would be able to carry more fighters than even the heaviest Navy warships. Given this fact, the Free Worlds have asked Southbound to restrict sale of the "Hauler III: Type F", "Skein" to its military only.`

  description "The Stymphalian is a missile boat and comes equipped with four missile launchers and enough ammunition to destroy ships many times its size. Because of their lack of manoeuvrability and relatively light shielding, Stymphalians serve best in hit-and-run attack waves. Once their missile supply is spent, they are relatively useless in combat."

  description "The Warrior is one of the most affordable ships designed by Southbound: a versatile ship that can serve equally well for escorting freighters or for bounty hunting. As with many of Southbound's designs, the hull is mostly composite fibre rather than metal, sacrificing armour strength for the sake of lighter weight and faster movement."

  description "The Argosy from Southbound Shipyards is very popular with merchants not because of its capacity, which is actually slightly smaller than the Syndicate Freighter, but because it can hold its own in combat even against a small pirate fleet."
  description "  The Argosy is also a very easy ship to upgrade with faster engines or more powerful weapons as needed, so many privately owned Argosies have very different capabilities than the stock model."

  description `Southbound Shipyards quickly answered the Free Worlds' call for a carrier by building modified cargo containers for Haulers - adding a pair of Fighter docking arms, some additional outfit space, and even a couple of bunks. Access to the fighters from within the ship is so inconvenient that most pilots opt to just stay aboard their fighters when in flight. While the technical name for this ship is "Hauler I: Type F", Southbound assembly workers started calling the single container variant the "Nest" due to its complement of Finch Fighters, and the name stuck.`

  description `Southbound Shipyards' new fighter-carrying containers have created a new use for what many considered an outdated design. Four external fighter bays make this the biggest civilian carrier on the market, if a little awkward as a warship. After Southbound assembly workers successfully named the "Nest", "Hauler II: Type F" was quickly dubbed the "Roost" to continue the theme.`

  description `This particular cockpit and engine set has found itself attached to three of Southbound Shipyards' new "Type F" Fighter-carrier pods. When the Free Worlds asked for a carrier, they did not expect one that would be able to carry more fighters than even the heaviest Navy warships. Given this fact, the Free Worlds have asked Southbound and Tarazed to restrict sale of the "Hauler III: Type F", "Skein" to its Militia only.`

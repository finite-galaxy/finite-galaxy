  description "Impact missiles are the most powerful homing weapon, but they move slowly enough that fast ships can simply outrun them, making them most useful against large targets or against small ships at times when they are too distracted to dodge. Impact launchers are also much larger than other missile systems, so they are most often found in capital ships."

  description "In the early part of the space era, the settlements in the region of space known as the Deep developed in relative isolation from the rest of human space. One result of that isolation is that their weapons technology mostly uses beam weapons, instead of the energy projectile weapons that are more common elsewhere."

  description "Laser Turrets are hated by fighter pilots because it is nearly impossible to dodge them once you are within their reach. This turret carries a pair of lasers and can swivel almost instantly to fire on new targets as they approach. Laser Turrets are especially useful when mounted on slow-moving freighters to fend off packs of small pirate vessels."

  description "The Heavy Laser Cannon is an upgraded Laser Cannon with a significantly longer range and higher power. It is mostly intended for larger ships, where energy and space are plentiful, but some pilots consider a single Heavy Laser to be a worthwhile alternative to a pair of ordinary lasers, because the longer range makes up for the fact that it does slightly less than twice as much damage."

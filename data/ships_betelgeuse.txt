  description "The Bulk Freighter is the ultimate cargo ship, able to carry as much cargo as four ordinary Star Freighters. It is also, however, an incredibly slow ship and difficult to manoeuvre, especially when loaded down with cargo. Some freight caravans use ordinary freighters instead of bulk freighters just to avoid the hassle of constantly having to wait for the Bulk Freighter to properly align itself for hyperspace travel."

As a result, the latest model is equipped only with turrets, including anti-missile turrets to prevent attackers from simply bombarding them into submission from a safe distance."

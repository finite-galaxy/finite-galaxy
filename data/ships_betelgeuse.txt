The Firebird is also a very rugged ship and easy to repair; supposedly a few of the Firebirds that fought in those wars are still in service today."

  description "Although Betelgeuse Shipyards produces other ship models as well, the majority of their profits come from sales of the Shuttle. This versatile ship serves equally well as a passenger transport or a cargo courier. It also happens to be the cheapest ship you can buy which is capable of hyperspace travel."
  description `  Shuttles are not designed to withstand combat of any sort, but they are fast and maneuverable enough to get out of harm's way if attacked by a larger, slower ship. Although they are typically unarmed, they have enough space for one weapon, which is the origin of the popular phrase, "as useless as a blaster cannon on a shuttlecraft."`

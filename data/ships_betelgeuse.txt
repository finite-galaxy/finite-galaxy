  description "The Aerie is a light carrier, designed to be just big enough for two fighter bays plus a decent armament of its own.

  description "The Argosy from Vortex Shipyards is very popular with merchants not because of its capacity, which is actually slightly smaller than the Star Freighter, but because it can hold its own in combat against pirate interceptors."
  description "  The Argosy is also a very easy ship to upgrade with faster engines or more powerful weapons as needed, so many privately owned Argosies have very different capabilities than the stock model."

  description "The Berserker is Betelgeuse Shipyard's popular design of escort ship. They have greater firepower than most other interceptor-class vessels, meaning that any pirate flying solo will think twice before attacking a convoy that is accompanied by a Berserker. However, Berserkers are also less manoeuvrable than other small ships."

It is basically nothing more than six blaster turrets attached to a set of engines and crew's quarters, designed as a defence platform that can accompany merchant convoys.`

  description "The Vanguard is Betelgeuse's newest warship intended for the heavy anti-pirate defence market. Vanguards offer an unusual feature set, focusing on powerful fixed guns and featuring Syndicated Systems' latest automation technologies, resulting in an atypically low crew complement for a ship its size. Few capital ships will endure for long under the withering fusillade of gunfire that it can unleash against those in front of it."

  description "The Headhunter is one of the newest ships designed by Lionheart: a versatile ship that can serve equally well for carrying valuable cargo, escorting freighters, or bounty hunting. It is capable of overtaking and defeating most other interceptors, such as Betelgeuse's Berserker, hence its name. As with all of Lionheart's designs, the Headhunter's hull is mostly composite fiber rather than metal, sacrificing armour strength for the sake of lighter weight and faster movement. "

  description "The Lionheart Bounder was designed back in the days when the galaxy was more sparsely populated, and ships prospecting for habitable worlds or worlds rich in resources would often travel far away from any habitable ports where they would be able to refuel. Although the galaxy has now been much more thoroughly explored, the Bounder remains a popular ship for long-distance travel."

  description "The Warrior is one of the most affordable ships designed by Lionheart: a versatile ship that can serve equally well for escorting freighters or for bounty hunting. As with many of Lionheart's designs, the hull is mostly composite fiber rather than metal, sacrificing armour strength for the sake of lighter weight and faster movement."

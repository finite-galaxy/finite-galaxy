  description "The Argosy from Vortex Shipyards is very popular with merchants not because of its capacity, which is actually slightly smaller than the Star Freighter, but because it can hold its own in combat even against a small pirate fleet."
  description "  The Argosy is also a very easy ship to upgrade with faster engines or more powerful weapons as needed, so many privately owned Argosies have very different capabilities than the stock model."

  description "The Headhunter is one of the newest ships designed by Lionheart: a versatile ship that can serve equally well for carrying valuable cargo, escorting freighters, or bounty hunting. It is capable of overtaking and defeating most other interceptors, hence its name. As with all of Lionheart's designs, the Headhunter's hull is mostly composite fiber rather than metal, sacrificing armour strength for the sake of lighter weight and faster movement. "

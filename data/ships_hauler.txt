  description "Several centuries ago, in the early days of the Republic, the sudden increase in commerce and space travel led to high demand for cargo ships. Haulers were first created simply by bolting a cockpit and engine block onto a cargo container, and the basic design has not changed much since then."

  description "This is a mid-sized freighter, designed for a balance between cargo capacity and defensive capability. Centuries ago, various Hauler models made up nearly half of the merchant vessels in service, but today the design is considered somewhat outdated."

  description `Southbound Shipyards quickly answered the Free Worlds' call for a carrier by building modified cargo containers for Haulers - adding a pair of Fighter docking arms, some additional outfit space, and even a couple of bunks. Access to the fighters from within the ship is so inconvenient that most pilots opt to just stay aboard their fighters when in flight. While the technical name for this ship is "Hauler I: Type F", Southbound assembly workers started calling the single container variant the "Nest" due to its complement of Finch Fighters, and the name stuck.`

  description `Southbound Shipyards' new fighter-carrying containers have created a new use for what many considered an outdated design. Four external fighter bays make this the biggest civilian carrier on the market, if a little awkward as a warship. After Southbound assembly workers successfully named the "Nest", "Hauler II: Type F" was quickly dubbed the "Roost" to continue the theme.`

  description `This particular cockpit and engine set has found itself attached to three of Southbound Shipyards' new "Type F" Fighter-carrier pods. When the Free Worlds asked for a carrier, they did not expect one that would be able to carry more fighters than even the heaviest Navy warships. Given this fact, the Free Worlds have asked Southbound and Tarazed to restrict sale of the "Hauler III: Type F", "Skein" to its Militia only.`

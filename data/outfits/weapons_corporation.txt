  description "The Meteor missile is the cheapest and simplest homing weapon available in human space. Meteors are quickly destroyed by anti-missile systems, and their infrared tracking systems have trouble homing in on targets with low heat levels. Nevertheless, their large warheads can spell doom for poorly-defended targets when the missiles are fired in great numbers."

  description "Although not the most accurate or damaging of weapons, the X1 Blaster Cannon is popular because it is small enough to be installed on even the tiniest of ships. One blaster is not enough to do appreciable damage to anything larger than a fighter, but a ship equipped with several of them becomes a force to be reckoned with."

  description "The X2 Blaster Turret is a pair of blasters mounted on a rotating platform, allowing it to fire in any direction. Sophisticated software algorithms allow the turret to correct for a target's motion, making the X2 Blaster Turret effective even against small, quickly moving fighters. Because it needs a special mounting point with a 360 degree field of view, not all ships are capable of being equipped with a turret."

  description "The X8 Blaster Turret consists of eight blasters attached to a single mount, thus having a lot of firepower concentrated in a single spot. It is useful for quickly destroying ships, although its high energy consumption and heat production make it unattractive for prolonged space fights. Though cruder and less efficient than its competition, the X8 Blaster Turret maintains a loyal following among captains dissatisfied with laser weapons' short range and low shield damage."

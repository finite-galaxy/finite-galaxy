  description "A Scram Drive is a specially designed hyperdrive that works even if your ship is travelling at a much higher speed, at the expense of generating heat whenever it is used. If you are being pursued by pirates (or just want to get somewhere in a hurry) that extra bit of speed can make a big difference."

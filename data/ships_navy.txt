  description "The Jupiter is more than just a warship: it is practically a mobile space station, with docking bays for an entire squadron of drones and fighters and enough crew to fill a small village. Although designed primarily for engaging enemies from a distance, a Jupiter can also do significant damage in close combat."

Because of their lack of manoeuvrability and relatively light shielding, Mercury serve best as long-range attack ships, and once their missile supply is spent, they are relatively useless in combat."

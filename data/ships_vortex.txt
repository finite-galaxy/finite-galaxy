  description "The Vortex Shipyards Firebird is a warship with a long and storied past; Firebirds fought on both sides of the Alpha Wars over half a millennium ago, and although the equipment and systems have been upgraded continuously since then, the basic design remains almost the same. The Firebird is also a very rugged ship and easy to repair; supposedly a few of the Firebirds that fought in those wars are still in service today."

  description "The Leviathan has been in service for a long time, and captains have had some very interesting ideas about how to modify them for optimum performance. This one has had the hull surface completely stripped off and replaced with a surface containing more shield projectors per square meter."

  description "This Leviathan once belonged to an infamous pirate captain whose name has been lost to the ages. It's had so much custom work done to it that can hardly even be considered the same ship. The weapons capacity, in particular has been massively increased."

  description "Although Vortex Shipyards produces other ship models as well, the majority of their profits come from sales of the Light Shuttle. This versatile ship serves equally well as a passenger transport or a cargo courier. It also happens to be the cheapest ship you can buy which is capable of hyperspace travel."
  description "  Shuttles are not designed to withstand combat of any sort, but they are fast and manoeuvrable enough to get out of harm's way if attacked by a larger, slower ship. Although they are typically unarmed, they have enough space for one weapon, which is the origin of the popular phrase, 'as useless as a blaster cannon on a shuttlecraft.'"

  description "The Vortex Bactrian is the last of the great city-ships, a design hearkening back to the early days of space colonization when a long-distance vessel needed to be a self-contained world, able to survive for weeks at a time without encountering an inhabited planet. It is not only a freighter, but a carrier, and a capable warship either at short range or at a distance. Naturally, this versatility also makes it extremely expensive, and the Bactrian is not normally for sale to ordinary citizens."

  description "The Vortex Shipyards Firebird is a warship with a long and storied past; Firebirds fought on both sides of the Alpha Wars over half a millennium ago, and although the equipment and systems have been upgraded continuously since then, the basic design remains almost the same. The Firebird is also a very rugged ship and easy to repair; supposedly a few of the Firebirds that fought in those wars are still in service today."

  description "Although Vortex Shipyards produces other ship models as well, the majority of their profits come from sales of the Light Shuttle. This versatile ship serves equally well as a passenger transport or a cargo courier. It also happens to be the cheapest ship you can buy which is capable of hyperspace travel."
  description `  Shuttles are not designed to withstand combat of any sort, but they are fast and manoeuvrable enough to get out of harm's way if attacked by a larger, slower ship. Although they are typically unarmed, they have enough space for one weapon, which is the origin of the popular phrase, "as useless as a blaster cannon on a shuttlecraft."`

  description `The design of the Mongrel seems to be a Mule condensed to the level of a Dagger, and as you look at the cockpit nestled between the massive gun port and turret mount, you wonder where the power systems are supposed to go. Needless to say, there is no room for a hyperdrive, fuel barrels, or cargo. The Mongrel is categorized as a bomber rather than a fighter, because of its relatively high weapon space, and because its awkward shape makes it unable to fit into ordinary fighter bays. Though its operation range is currently rather limited, it seems flexible enough to become a dangerous addition to warfleets, if ever any bomber carriers will be designed.`

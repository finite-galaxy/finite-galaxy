  "energy capacity" 900
  description "Because Coalition ships rely on solar power, they must also be able to store a substantial amount of energy. This small battery pack is much more efficient than comparable human technology."

  category "Energy Capacity"

  cost 5000
  "mass" 1
  "outfit space" -1
  "energy capacity" 50
  description "With a powerful enough generator, many ships do not need batteries at all. The one exception is projectile weapons, which usually require a burst of energy far exceeding what the generator produces. Supercapacitors provide just enough energy storage for those weapons, without requiring you to install a bulky battery pack."

  category "Energy Capacity"
  thumbnail "outfit/battery_tiny_b"
  cost 10000
  "mass" 8
  "outfit space" -8
  "energy capacity" 750
  description "A ship can run without batteries if its generator's instantaneous power output is higher than the total energy consumption of its systems, but batteries make it possible to store up energy when it is not needed and thus to use a much smaller and cheaper generator."

  category "Energy Capacity"
  thumbnail "outfit/battery_small_b"
  cost 26000
  "mass" 16
  "outfit space" -16
  "energy capacity" 1650
  description "This battery pack has more than twice the energy capacity of the most basic model, allowing your ship to engage in combat for longer periods of time before running out of energy. Some pilots have even been known to install these in lieu of any generator at all, trusting that they can reach their destination planet and recharge before running out of battery power, but that is a risky proposition."

  cost 57000
  "mass" 32
  "outfit space" -32
  "energy capacity" 3650
  description "This medium-sized battery pack is intended for ships that need to fire the occasional salvo of high-powered weaponry without running out of energy. As with all battery packs, relying on batteries is risky if combat lasts long enough for them to become depleted."

  cost 323000
  "mass" 128
  "outfit space" -128
  "energy capacity" 17750
  description "For most ships that require this much power, a larger generator makes more sense than a battery this size. However, battery packs have the advantage that they generate no heat, so some captains use them instead of powerful generators if they do not expect to be in combat frequently or for extended periods of time."

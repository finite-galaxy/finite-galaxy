  description `After introducing the "Type F" cargo pod for the Hauler, it became apparent to merchant captains that the new carriers could offer more flexibility within their fleet, if there were a cargo box they could attach to the fighter arms. Enter the "F6-C: Boxwing", the Fighter that doesn't fight, but carries cargo instead. Cargo preservation equipment gives the Boxwing much more mass and very poor heat dissipation characteristics compared to other fighters. That it cannot carry any weapons is only part of the reason jocks call it "Flying Coffin" amongst themselves; besides the ship resembling one and being very sluggish, the pilot "seat" doubles as a bunk, and is cramped beyond the comfort level of most. The interactive panoramic window H.U.D. is the only thing that keeps claustrophobic episodes from becoming a major problem.`

  description "The Bulk Freighter is the ultimate cargo ship, able to carry as much cargo as four ordinary Syndicate Freighters. It is also, however, an incredibly slow ship and difficult to manoeuvre, especially when loaded down with cargo. Some freight caravans use ordinary freighters instead of bulk freighters just to avoid the hassle of constantly having to wait for the Bulk Freighter to properly align itself for hyperspace travel."

As a result, the latest model of freighter is equipped only with turrets, including an anti-missile turret to prevent attackers from simply bombarding them into submission from a safe distance."

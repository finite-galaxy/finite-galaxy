help "refuel"
  `On each planet there are different fuel prices. Currently your ship will refuel whenever you land and the planet supports refueling you. You can change that behaviour in the settings. Until then this screen will be pretty much useless for you.`
  `Here the fuel price is displayed and you can decide to fill your fleets fuel tanks by a certain amount.`
  `Fuel is a very important resource. You need it to jump to other systems. So don't forget to refuel.`

  description "The Tarazed Blackbird is a high-class passenger transport, designed to move large numbers of people across the galaxy with speed and safety. Although not equipped with much weaponry, a Blackbird is well armoured and fast enough to evade pirate attacks, and its cargo capacity is high enough to allow the captain to take courier missions on the side."

  description "The Tarazed Hawk is an interceptor-class warship often used as an escort for freighters or in a planetary militia's patrol squadron. Hawks are fast enough to chase down most smaller ships, but are capable of mounting much more weapons, including a turret. They are also, of course, a favorite ship of pirate captains who have earned enough money to afford one."

There he saw visions of a strange and elegant starship. Returning to his work with renewed purpose, he spent the next seven years making the Kestrel a reality."

The Osprey was the result. Although it is considered overpriced by most savvy pilots, it is nevertheless a perennial favourite among those who have the extra cash to spend on it."

  description "The Tarazed Blackbird is a high-class passenger transport, designed to move large numbers of people across the galaxy with speed and safety. Although not equipped with much weaponry, a Blackbird is well armoured and fast enough to evade pirate attacks, and its cargo capacity is high enough to allow the captain to take courier missions on the side."

  description "The Goose is the freighter-warship produced by Tarazed. Apparently someone wanted a bit more out of it, and has covered large sections of the hull with extra shield emitters and hull plating. Much of the stock cargo space has been converted to outfit, weapons and engines space, coupled with streamlining of existing internal systems make this Corvette an agile and flexible war machine."

Large sections of the hull are covered with extra shield emitters and hull plating.

  description "The Tarazed Hawk is an interceptor-class warship often used as an escort for freighters or in a planetary militia's patrol squadron. Hawks are fast enough to chase down most smaller ships, but are capable of mounting much more weapons, including a turret. They are also, of course, a favorite ship of pirate captains who have earned enough money to afford one."

  description "The Tarazed Raven is their most popular warship, an agile and elegant vessel that can nevertheless deal out and absorb considerable damage. Ravens are a favourite ship for bounty hunters, because they are more than a match for pirate interceptors and can be used by a skilled pilot to take down much larger ships as well."

This one appears to have been modified for even more of the latter, at the expense of the former, and You only recognize it as a Raven by the wingtips. A third engine bay, more outfit space, additional shield emitters, and a turret make this already deadly warship appear even more frightening."

  description "The Tarazed Blackbird is a high-class passenger transport, designed to move large numbers of people across the galaxy with speed and safety. Although not equipped with much weaponry, a Blackbird is well armoured and fast enough to evade pirate attacks, and its cargo capacity is high enough to allow the captain to take courier missions on the side."

  description "The Tarazed Hawk is an interceptor-class warship often used as an escort for freighters or in a planetary militia's patrol squadron. Hawks are fast enough to chase down most smaller ships, but are capable of mounting much more weapons, including a turret. They are also, of course, a favorite ship of pirate captains who have earned enough money to afford one."

  description "The Tarazed Raven is their most popular warship, an agile and elegant vessel that can nevertheless deal out and absorb considerable damage. Ravens are a favourite ship for bounty hunters, because they are more than a match for pirate interceptors and can be used by a skilled pilot to take down much larger ships as well."

  description "Tarazed's elegant Raven has gained popularity with pirates because of its agility. This one appears to have been modified for even more of the latter, at the expense of the former, and You only recognize it as a Raven by the wingtips. A third engine bay, more outfit space, additional shield emitters, and a turret make this already deadly warship appear even more frightening."

  description "The modifier of this Raven has given more heft to an agile and elegant vessel. They've added a turret and some apparently flimsy bulkheads over extra shield emitters and outfit space. If it weren't for the wingtips, you would barely recognize Tarazed's ship under the patchwork that you expect has made an already deadly warship even more so."

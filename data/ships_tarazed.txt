  description "The Tarazed Blackbird is a high-class passenger transport, designed to move large numbers of people across the galaxy with speed and safety. Although not equipped with much weaponry, a Blackbird is well shielded and fast enough to evade pirate attacks, and its cargo capacity is high enough to allow the captain to take courier missions on the side."

  description "When the Free Worlds started requesting a carrier solution from its local shipyards, Tarazed Shipyards quickly saw that a few modifications could make their entry level interceptor into a top tier fighter. Over 85% of the parts that make up the Finch are shared with the Sparrow assembly line, so it's no surprise that even trimmed down to (barely) fit into a fighter bay, the Finch bears strong resemblance to its hyperspace-faring cousin."

Hawks are fast enough to chase down most smaller ships, while also being much more heavily armed and armoured. They are also, of course, a favourite ship of pirate captains who have earned enough money to afford one."

  description "Classified as an interceptor rather than a fighter because it has its own "Hyperdrive" instead of needing to be carried inside a larger ship, the Tarazed Sparrow is the smallest and cheapest combat ship available. Because of its limited cargo and passenger space, the primary way for a Sparrow pilot to pay the bills is by hunting pirates... or by becoming one. In either case, it is a perilous way to earn a living."

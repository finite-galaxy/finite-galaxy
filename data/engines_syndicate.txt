	description `When designing the Barb, the Syndicate took the opportunity to integrate their smallest thruster models to create a more compact steering and thrusting engine. The result is not very useful on anything but a fighter, and is only "adequate" in that role. Still, if engine space is at a premium, this is the smallest set of engines that will still get you there (eventually).`

	description "This is the smallest thruster that you can buy, so weak that anything larger than a drone will accelerate quite slowly when using this engine. On the other hand, it is also very energy-efficient."
	description "	Ion engines consume less energy than plasma engines and produce less heat, but they also take up more space."

	description "The X2700 ion thruster is intended mostly for use in small, single-person or two-person ships, as well as in fighters. It is also used in larger ships, such as freighters, that have very little space for propulsion systems or energy to drive them. But these larger ships move unbearably slowly as a result."

	description "The X3700 ion thruster is designed for heavy freighters and small capital ships. In theory, it could be installed in smaller ships too, if they have enough engine space, to attain almost ridiculous speeds."
	description "	Ion engines consume less energy than plasma engines and produce less heat, but they also take up more space."

	description "The X4700 ion thruster was developed when the Republic Navy began building warships so large that the X3700 was not sufficient for them. It allows even a capital ship to move at a respectable speed."

	description "The X5700 thruster is intended for only the largest of capital ships. When the Syndicate first began producing them, these engines were considered little more than a publicity stunt, because no ship at the time was large enough to hold one."

	description "This is the smallest set of steering thrusters that you can buy, generally considered suitable only for tiny, pilotless drones. Occasionally pilots looking for some extra outfit space will try swapping out their larger steering systems for one of these, but the results are invariably disappointing."

	description "The X3200 steering system is intended for small warships and freighters. It produces enough turning force to lend agility to all but the largest of human ships, and it is considerably more energy-efficient than the plasma-drive alternatives."

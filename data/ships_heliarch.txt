  description `Anyone who incurs the wrath of the Heliarch cannot count on making a fast getaway thanks to the Interdictors, which were primarily designed to carry a pair of attractor and repulsor beams that can hold a ship a safe distance away while pushing it around enough to prevent it from getting a hyperspace lock to jump out of the system.`

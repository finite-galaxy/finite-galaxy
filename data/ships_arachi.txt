  description `These hardy little cargo ships are the perfect size for young Arachi just setting out into the sky with dreams of one day building their own merchant fleets. Of course, an Arachi lucky enough to be born into one of the great Houses can probably find a patron to buy them a much larger ship instead.`

  description `The Arachi believe that efficient functionality is the highest form of beauty, and none of their ships demonstrate that principle more clearly than the ugly yet utilitarian Hulk, designed with detachable side pods that can be swapped out on a planet in a matter of minutes if the captain is in a hurry to reach the next destination.`

  description `The Arachi Hulk is an ungainly, lumbering behemoth of a ship, but with its side pods removed it becomes the much more manoeuvrable Spindle. Because of its much lower cargo space, usually the only reason a fleet would include a Spindle is if they are planning on picking up new cargo pods at their destination.`

  description `The Arachi Transport is the oldest of their ship designs, dating back to the time when they first joined the Coalition in overthrowing the Quarg and capturing their ringworlds. Back then, Transports were occasionally used as warships, but now, thousands of years later, they are considered outdated compared to the latest Heliarch military ships.`

  description `Arachi cargo ship hulls are legendary for their durability. It is not uncommon for a large Arachi family to convert a freighter that is no longer space-worthy into a planet-side dwelling, and even in the harshest of conditions these converted houses can last for hundreds of years with little or no exterior maintenance.`

  description "The Javelin Pod fires rapid, unguided missiles in bursts of up to 15, after which it needs to cool down and reload. This allows it to overwhelm anti-missile systems, but also means it can not fire for a relatively longer time after each burst. A Javelin Pod does far more damage than any gun of a comparable size, and has a longer range as well, but once a ship has fired off all its ammunition it must leave combat and find a planet where it can buy more, which makes Javelins less useful in protracted battles. As a result, they are very popular with pirates as a way to quickly disable a small target."

  description "A crude but impressive-looking weapon, the Flamethrower ignites your hyperspace fuel and directs a stream of it towards your adversaries. The damage it does is relatively minor, but it can be useful for causing a target that is already operating near its thermal capacity to overheat, temporarily taking it out of the fight."
